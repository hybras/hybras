# Hi there 👋

I'm Varun Chari, I completed my bachelor degree in https://www.cs.umd.edu/[CS/Math major] @ https://www.umd.edu[UMD], class of 2024.

I love learning new programming languages and math. I read in my free time, though there hasn't been https://weheartit.com/entry/164749997[much of that lately].

Feel free to call me `hybras`, It's my 2nd name at this point. In the https://www.eoincolfer.com/artemis-fowl[Artemis Fowl bookseries, by Eoin Colfer], the island of Hybras is the home of demons, exiled from the timeline. I guess I just liked the name (I don't really know, I began using the name years after reading the books).

As for my pfp, its the incognito logo from chrome (though it has since been slightly updated).
